# NOTES
# documentation here: http://assets.newport.com/webDocuments-EN/images/15236.PDF
# this motor has no encoder - steps taken are only measured by number of pulses sent to the drivers
# not all pulses will result in a step, since the piezo motor works by friction of a screw
# calibration necessary

# SERIAL SETTINGS
# Bits per second 19200 
# Data bits 8 
# Parity NONE 
# Stop Bits 1 
# Flow control NONE

# EXAMPLE
# initialize network
ini
# check status
sta
# select motor 0 on driver 1 (i.e. x motor on mirror 1)
chl a1=0
# confirm that motor 0 of driver 1 is selected
chl a1
# set velocity of motor 0 on driver 1 to 1000 (steps/s)
vel a1 0=1000
# check acceleration on driver 1 (steps/s^2)
acc a1
# plan 1000 forward pulses to motor 0 on driver 1
rel a1=1000
# move motor 0 on driver 1 1000 steps forward
go a1
# check that 1000 forward pulses were sent
pos
# send 1000 backwards pulses to motor 0 on driver 1
rel a1=-1000
# move motor 0 on driver 1 1000 steps backward
go a1
# check that 1000 backward pulses were sent
pos
# gradually stop the motor if it goes too far
hal
# sav the current settings (velocities, accelerations)
